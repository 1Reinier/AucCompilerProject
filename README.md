This is our project for AUC course 'Advanced Programming'.Nov-15, 2012Today we decided to proceed in the following way:1) We are going to write    a. A parser for the esoteric programing language 'Brainfuck';    b. An evaluator for Brainfuck;    -> A type checker is not needed, since there are no types in Brainfuck.2) If it turns out that the project is to easy, we might include another esoteric programing language, like 'Whitespace'.-- Joost, David, Reinier
